Deduction Learning code for blood glucose prediction from PPG signal

                           Version 1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This code consists N parts:

1. ppg_analy.py:
   The PPG signal preprocessing and analysis code.

2. Signal_pairing.ipynb:
   Pairing mechanism for grouping iteration i and iteration i-1

3. IL Model.ipynb:
   The Induction Learning code
   
4. DL Model.ipynb:
   The Deduction Learning code.

5. ROC-curve.ipynb

6. Screening-Rule part (in the DL Model.ipynb)

Currently we have ppg_analy.py code ready for posting in github, and
the other parts are still under checking and preparation. They will
be posted as soon as everything is ready.

Usage:

- ppg_analy.py:

  To use this code, the system should install python (>= 3.5), python
  modules numpy, scipy, and gnuplot.

  This code reads the index file "sub_info*.txt", from which find the
  PPG signal data files, and proceed the signal analysis. The PPG signals
  consist Left hand, Right hand, each measured with IR and RD. The code
  parameters are configurable through the config file "ppg_input.txt".
  The code outputs the following data files:

  - *_signal.txt:
    The denoised AC and DC singals of the raw PPG signal.

  - *_minmax.txt:
    The indices of pulse separation of the PPG AC signal.

  - *_peak.txt, *_peaklist.txt, *_dA1res.txt:
    The morphological features of pulse waveform extracted from the PPG
    AC signal.

  - *_sigIRFT.txt, *_sigRDFT.txt:
    The Fourier transformed data of the PPG AC signal.

  - *_step.txt:
    The summarized list of extracted morphological features.

  To run this code, please put "ppg_analy.py" and "ppg_input.txt" in the
  same working directory, and run the command:

        python3 ./ppg_analy.py <full path of sub_info file>

- Signal_pairing.ipynb:
  Input the file that after ppg_analy.py.And output the file with paired PPG pulse.
